You can see here too : https://rpubs.com/mardhik/827934

The data that I used : https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data

1. The accuracy is 93,44%
2. The best accuracy in digit "0" , "1" , "6"
3. The model is less accurate in predicting the digit "3" , "8" , "9"
4. The model has been confused several times predicting between the numbers "4 "with "9" , "3" with "8" , "7" with "9"

 only use 10% of data for train and validation, if I add the number, the accuracy might be better
